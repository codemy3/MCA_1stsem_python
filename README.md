# MCA 1st Semester Python Programs

This repository contains Python programs demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as inheritance, multiple inheritance, exception handling, and custom exceptions. These examples help in understanding OOP principles through practical implementations.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Classes & Objects**: Basic
- implementation of OOP principles.  
- **Inheritance**: Single, multiple, and multi-level inheritance.  
- **Method Overriding**: Demonstration of `super()` for method calls.  
- **Custom Exceptions**: Handling errors using user-defined exceptions.  

## 📂 Programs Included  
1. **Bank Account Management**  
2. **Student Grade Calculation**  
3. **Vehicle and Car Inheritance**  
4. **Box Class with Multiple Inheritance**  
5. **Shipping Box Volume Calculation**  
6. **Animal Class Hierarchy (Mammals, Birds, Fish)**  
7. **Custom Zero Division Exception Handling**
